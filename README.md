# audiovisualToAudial-CLI
A simple script written in python, that helps the user convert a video with **any file extension** into an audio file, the laborious-free way. This can come handy as the audio file generated as a result is devoid of any mismatch with the quality of the target video file.  

## Requirements.
* Run the command in the terminal to install the **moviepy** module.  
```
pip install moviepy
```
* Run the command in the terminal to install the **ffmpeg** module. Though the module comes pre-installed with the **moviepy** library, a few objects may be omitted while installation.  
```
pip install ffmpeg
```
